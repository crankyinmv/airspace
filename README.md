To run:

Copy this directory tree (minus this readme) to a location reachable from a web server. I used Apache while developing, but any should do. 
The server should be able to run PHP code. 
Your PHP installation should have cURL enabled.
Since I didn't do a polyfill, the browser needs to support CSS grid.

/index.html should suffice to run the application / should also work depending on your web server settings.

Please feel free to contact me if there are any problems or further questions.

Thanks.
